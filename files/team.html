                <p id="contact-para">Braille books play a crucial role in ensuring equal access to literature and information for individuals with visual impairments. These books provide a means for blind and visually impaired individuals to engage with written content, fostering independence, education, and inclusion. However, the availability of Braille books is currently limited, and their prices are high, not only because of printing materials, but for the lack of accurate computer transcriptions necessitating a human transcriber.
                <br>We are a team of 4 high school students who are into computer science and programming. We created this translator because many Blind people don't have access to braille books. Providing free machine translations will reduce the labor required in creating braille books.</p>
